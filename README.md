# RPA_Project
My First RPA project, See how it works !!!
## Day 1 20240303
RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation, it sounds interesting.
After watchiing so many videos, firstly, I noticed that most of them are created by indian and Most rpa tools are none-programing based. It only need you to drag and drop some parts of its components. I also noticed a web recorder which is very useful in real life indeed.
